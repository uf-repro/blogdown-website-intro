# Motivations

* You would like a professional-looking website to present yourself.
* You don't want to spend time/money designing something completely custom.
* You want to use or learn github / blogdown.
* You want to make blogposts using R Markdown.

---
# Prerequisites

This lesson assumes you:
`r gsub("\n ", "\n", desc::desc_get("prerequisites"))`

Such as via `r desc::desc_get("priorCourse")`

---
# Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r gsub("\n ", "\n", desc::desc_get("learningOutcomes"))`

# Setup

---
# Required Packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("usethis"
                   "blogdown", 
                   "renv"))
```

These packages and their included dependencies will have all the tools that we need to get started.

---
# Git and RStudio

RStudio is not required, but does make some steps easier, so I strongly recommend it.

If you have not yet configured Git and GitHub for use from within RStudio, check out these guides:
* ["Happy Git and GitHub for the useR"](https://happygitwithr.com/)
* ["Managing Git(Hub) Credentials"](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html)

---
# Install Hugo

Hugo is a static site generator that we will use. This code from the blogdown package will install the latest version and make it available to us.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

---

# Creating a new site

---
# Choose a name

The address will be https://{username}.github.io/{repo}

e.g. for my username `ha0ye` and repo `my-site`, the eventual website address will be https://ha0ye.github.io/my-site/

You can also host at https://{username}.github.io/
- choose `{username}.github.io` as the repo name.

---
# New RStudio Project

1. Open RStudio.
2. `File` -> `New Project`
3. Select `New Directory`
4. Use the name previously chosen, set the local directory, and `Create Project`.

---
# Create Blogdown Site

```{r, eval = FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(
    theme = "hugo-apero/hugo-apero", 
    format = "toml",
    sample = FALSE,
    empty_dirs = TRUE)
```

---
# Set `baseURL`

Open `config.toml`.

There are a number of configuration options here.
Right now, set baseURL to the eventual URL of your site.

For example:
```
baseURL = "https://ha0ye.github.io/blogdown-demo"
```

---
# Activate renv

The `renv` package will capture all the needed packages to build our website and record this information in configuration files that GitHub will use.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
renv::init()
```

---
# Setup GitHub Actions

We need to give GitHub instructions on how to build our website, and there is a premade script for us to use.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_github_action("blogdown")
```

---
# Commit and Push

These commands will enable Git for this project, and then push it to a new repo on GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github()
```

# Technical Machinery

# Hugo

Hugo is a **static site generator**. (there are many other applications that do similar things)

It combines your content with a set of theme/style files to create a static HTML webpage.

*You can create content in markdown, and not worry about styling.*

---
# Blogdown

The `{{blogdown}}` package combines R Markdown and Hugo.
* you can author pages using R Markdown (so you can create code examples)
* it uses Hugo, so you have access to any Hugo theme.

---
# Blogdown Preview

In your website project, you can preview the webpage with
```{r, eval = FALSE}
blogdown::serve_site()
```

* You can pop out the panel from RStudio to your web browser.
* It will re-render when you save changes.

---
# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages will host websites from github repos for you, in the `github.io` domain.

*GitHub Pages can also render using __Jekyll__, but we are ignoring it for now.*

For GitHub Pages to work, we need to specify where the website files are. We choose the `gh-pages` branch, where only the rendered web files will be stored.

---
# GitHub Pages Configuration

In the GitHub page, navigate to "Settings"

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
#| fig.alt = "GitHub Settings page for a repository. The settings tab is circled with a magenta oval and labeled with '1.' in magenta text."
knitr::include_graphics("gh-settings.png", dpi = 200)
```

---
# GitHub Pages Configuration

then select "Pages"

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
#| fig.alt = "GitHub Settings page fora repository. The 'Pages' menu item on the left is circled with a magenta oval and labeled with '2.' in magenta text."
knitr::include_graphics("gh-settings-pages.png", dpi = 200)
```

---
# GitHub Pages Configuration

then select the "gh-pages" branch as the source and click "Save".

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
#| fig.alt = "GitHub Settings page for a repository. In the 'Source' setting, the 'Branch' pulldown menu is open and set to 'gh-pages' and is circled with a magenta oval and labeled with '3.' in magenta text."
knitr::include_graphics("gh-settings-pages-source.png", dpi = 200)
```

---
# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions lets us do workflow automation on GitHub.

Our provided script will setup an R environment to build our website, and then put the website files into the `gh-pages` branch.

This means, when we update the contents in GitHub, it will render and update the website automatically.

---
# Workflow

Suggested website workflow:
1. Open the RStudio project for your website.
2. Start live previews with `blogdown::serve_site()`
3. Make changes to the website
4. Commit changes and push to GitHub.

# Customization

---
# Menus

`config.toml` also determines the top-level menu of your website and what the links are.

You can customize the links, including adding your own or removing the defaults.

See [the doc page](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/start/site-config/) for more information.

---
# Static Files

Files that you want accessible to your website, but not processed through Hugo should go in the `/static/` folder.

* it is common to put images in `/static/img/`.
* The file `/static/img/image.jpg` becomes https://ha0ye.github.io/blogdown-demo/img/image.jpg on the website.

---
# Fonts and Colors

You can choose from among the theme's built-in fonts and colors by editing `config.toml`.

Customization is available, but will require you to go to extra effort to specify the exact colors and fonts to use.

See [the doc page](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/start/site-config/) for more information.

# Content

---
# Basics

The contents of the website are determined by the files in the `content/` folder.

Each folder corresponds to a section of the website, and has a page that can be linked.

For example, the `about/` folder contains files to create the  https://ha0ye.github.io/blogdown-demo/about page.

---
# Sections

Each section has a `_index.md` file that contains metadata about how the section will be formatted, and sometimes some descriptive text.

This information is in a **yaml** section at the top of the markdown file that begins and ends with

```
---
```

---
# Pages

Within each section, individual pages can be individual markdown files, or folders with an `index.md` file.

---
# Styling

There are built-in layouts that determine how a page is formatted.
You can set this in the `layout: ` field in the YAML header.

For more info, see the examples in the template or the docs on 
* [section configuration](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/start/section-config/)
* [page configuration](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/start/page-config/)
