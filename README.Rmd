`r lesson_description`

## Prerequisites
```{r, include = FALSE}
prereqs <- c("have some familiarity making *repos* and *commits*", 
             "know how to synchronize repos from your computer to GitHub")
prereqs_text <- paste0("* ", prereqs, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("prerequisites", prereqs_text)

prior_course <- "https://uf-repro.github.io/friendly-github-intro/"
desc::desc_set("priorCourse", prior_course)
```

This lesson assumes you know:

`r prereqs_text`

Such as via `r prior_course`

## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("describe the principles of Quarto documents", 
                       "create a basic website in Quarto",
                       "describe the workflow for continuous deployment", 
                       "deploy a Quarto website using GitHub Actions")
outcomes_text <- paste0("* ", learning_outcomes, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("learningOutcomes", outcomes_text)
```

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r outcomes_text`


```{r make cff file, include = FALSE}
cffr::cff_write(keys = list("type" = "lesson"))
```
